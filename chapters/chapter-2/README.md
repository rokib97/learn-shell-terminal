# Chapter 2: Filesystem

Welcome to **Chapter 2: Filesystem**! In this chapter, you'll explore the structure of filesystems, including file paths, directories, and file management commands. You'll learn how to navigate, manipulate, and search through files efficiently using essential commands like `ls`, `grep`, `find`, and tools for file manipulation such as `touch`, `move`, and `remove`.

By the end of this chapter, you'll be comfortable with filesystem concepts and will have the skills to manage files and directories effectively from the terminal.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

1. **Understand the structure of filesystems**: Learn how filesystems are organized, including directories, files, and their paths.
2. **Master navigation and file paths**: Become proficient in using absolute and relative file paths, navigating parent and child directories.
3. **Manipulate files and directories**: Learn to create, remove, move, and copy files and directories using common terminal commands like `touch`, `rm`, `mv`, and `cp`.
4. **Work with files efficiently**: Use tools like `head`, `tail`, `more`, and `less` to view file contents, and understand how to search for files with `find` and `grep`.
5. **Handle complex filesystem tasks**: Gain confidence in managing files, directories, and searching through them with advanced commands.

## Chapter Overview

- **Lesson 1: What Is a Filesystem?**: Understand the core concepts of filesystems, including their purpose and structure.
- **Lesson 2: Filepaths**: Learn how file paths are represented and their significance in accessing files and directories.
- **Lesson 3: Parent Directories**: Explore how parent directories are related to the current directory and how to navigate them.
- **Lesson 4: Absolute vs. Relative Paths**: Understand the difference between absolute and relative paths and when to use them.
- **Lesson 5: Files**: Get to know how files are handled within a filesystem and explore basic file commands.
- **Lesson 6: `head` and `tail`**: Learn how to use `head` and `tail` to view the beginning and end of files.
- **Lesson 7: `more` and `less`**: Master the `more` and `less` commands to view long files and navigate through their content.
- **Lesson 8: `touch`**: Learn how to create empty files with `touch` and modify timestamps of existing files.
- **Lesson 9: Directories**: Understand how to create, list, and navigate directories with commands like `mkdir` and `ls`.
- **Lesson 10: `move`**: Learn how to move files and directories using the `mv` command.
- **Lesson 11: `remove`**: Master the `rm` command to safely remove files and directories.

- **Lesson 13: Home**: Understand the concept of the home directory and how to navigate to it easily.
- **Lesson 14: `grep`**: Learn how to search for specific text within files using the powerful `grep` command.
- **Lesson 15: `find`**: Master the `find` command for searching and locating files within the filesystem based on various criteria.

## Prerequisites

This chapter assumes that you have a basic understanding of how to use the terminal, as covered in Chapter 1. Familiarity with basic navigation and shell concepts will help you dive deeper into file manipulation and search techniques.

## Getting Started

Start with the first lesson, [What Is a Filesystem?](./lesson-1/README.md), to get an introduction to the foundational concepts behind filesystems. From there, continue through each lesson to build your skills in navigating and managing files effectively.
