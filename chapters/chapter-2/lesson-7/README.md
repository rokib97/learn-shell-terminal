# Lesson 7: Navigating Command History

## Re-running Commands Efficiently

Typing out long commands repeatedly can be tedious. To save time, you can easily navigate your command history.

### Using Arrow Keys

- **Up Arrow (↑):** Scroll backward through your previous commands.
- **Down Arrow (↓):** Scroll forward to more recent commands.

**Example:**

1. Type the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   echo hello
   echo world
   ```

2. Press the **up arrow** to navigate back through these commands.
3. Press the **down arrow** to return to the most recent command.

### Clearing the Terminal

If your terminal feels cluttered, you can clear it without losing your command history.

- Run the `clear` command:

  ```bash
  clear
  ```

- Or press **Ctrl + L** to clear the screen.

**Note:** Clearing the terminal only removes visible text but keeps the command history intact.
