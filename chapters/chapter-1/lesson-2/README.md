# Lesson 2: Command Line vs. GUI

## Command Line Interface (CLI)

A **Command Line Interface (CLI)** allows users to interact with their computer in a text-based way by typing commands. For example, running a Python script can be done using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Advantages of CLI

- **Greater Control:** Provides more control over the system compared to a GUI.
- **Faster Operations:** Experienced users can perform tasks faster by typing commands.
- **Automation:** Commands can be easily automated using scripts.
- **Reproducibility:** Command-line instructions are easy to share and replicate.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

A **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** allows users to interact with their computer using visual elements like icons, buttons, and menus. While easier for beginners, it has some limitations:

- **Limited Flexibility:** Users are restricted to predefined options.
- **Slower for Advanced Tasks:** Clicking through menus can be slower than typing commands.
- **Difficult to Automate:** Automating tasks in a GUI is more challenging than in a CLI.
- **Less Reproducible:** GUI actions are harder to document and share.

## Key Command

- `whoami`  
  Displays the username of the current user logged into the system.  
  **Run this command in your terminal to verify your current user:**

  ```bash
  whoami
  ```
