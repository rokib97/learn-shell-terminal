# Lesson 3: What Is a Terminal?

## Understanding the Terminal

The terms **shell**, **CLI**, and **terminal** are often used interchangeably to describe programs for issuing text-based commands. However, they have distinct meanings:

- **Terminal:** Originally referred to a physical device (keyboard and screen) used for typing commands.
- **Terminal Emulator:** A modern program that emulates a physical terminal, allowing users to enter commands in a window on their computer.
- **Shell:** The program that interprets and executes the commands entered in the terminal emulator.

## Function of a Terminal Emulator

A **terminal emulator** is responsible for:

- Displaying text on the screen.
- Processing user keystrokes.
- Communicating with the shell to execute commands.

The terminal emulator itself does not determine which commands are availableâ€”that's the role of the shell.

## Example Terminal Emulators

- **macOS:** Terminal, iTerm2
- **Linux:** GNOME Terminal, Konsole
- **Windows:** Command Prompt, PowerShell, Windows Terminal

Understanding how a terminal emulator works is essential for effective command-line usage and system navigation.
