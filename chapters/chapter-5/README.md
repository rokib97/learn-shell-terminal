# Chapter 5: Input/Output

Welcome to **Chapter 2: Input/Output**! In this chapter, you'll explore how Unix-based systems handle data flow through standard input, output, and error streams. You'll learn essential concepts such as piping, redirection, exit codes, and process management. By mastering these topics, you'll be able to efficiently control and manipulate command-line operations, improving your productivity and debugging skills.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

1. **Master documentation tools** – Learn how to use the `man` command to explore command-line utilities and options.
2. **Work with command-line arguments** – Understand how to pass flags and positional arguments to modify command behavior.
3. **Understand exit codes** – Learn how commands signal success or failure and how to use them for scripting and debugging.
4. **Control standard streams** – Gain the ability to redirect input, output, and error streams effectively.
5. **Chain commands with pipes** – Utilize pipes (`|`) to combine commands and manipulate data efficiently.
6. **Manage running processes** – Learn how to interrupt processes and safely terminate unresponsive programs.
7. **Apply the Unix philosophy** – Understand the principles behind Unix design and their impact on modern computing.

## Chapter Overview

- **Lesson 1: Understanding `man` (Manual Pages)**  
  Learn how to use the `man` command to read documentation for Unix commands and tools.

- **Lesson 2: Using Command-line Flags**  
  Understand how flags modify command behavior and how to combine multiple options effectively.

- **Lesson 3: Working with Positional Arguments**  
  Discover how arguments are passed to commands and how they affect execution.

- **Lesson 4: Getting Help in the Shell**  
  Explore built-in help commands like `--help` and `info` for quick guidance.

- **Lesson 5: Understanding Exit Codes**  
  Learn about the significance of exit codes, how to check them, and how they help in automation and scripting.

- **Lesson 6: Handling Standard Output (stdout)**  
  Understand how to display and redirect command output to files and other commands.

- **Lesson 7: Handling Standard Error (stderr)**  
  Learn how to capture error messages separately from standard output.

- **Lesson 8: Accepting Standard Input (stdin)**  
  Explore how commands accept input from files, users, and other processes.

- **Lesson 9: Using Piping to Chain Commands**  
  Learn how to use the pipe (`|`) to connect multiple commands and process data efficiently.

- **Lesson 10: Handling Interrupt Signals**  
  Understand how to stop running processes using keyboard shortcuts like `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+Z`.

- **Lesson 11: Killing a Malicious Process**  
  Learn different ways to terminate processes using `kill`, `pkill`, and `killall` commands.

- **Lesson 12: The Unix Philosophy**  
  Explore the core principles of Unix design that promote simplicity, modularity, and reusability.

- **Lesson 13: Monitoring Processes with `top`**  
  Learn how to use the `top` command to monitor system performance and resource usage in real time.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this chapter, it's helpful to have a basic understanding of navigating the terminal and executing simple shell commands, as covered in **Chapter 1: Terminals and Shells**.

## Getting Started

Begin with [Lesson 1: Understanding `man` (Manual Pages)](./lesson-1/README.md) to learn how to explore command documentation and get the most out of the Unix command-line environment.
