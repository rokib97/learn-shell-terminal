# Understanding the `man` Command

The `man` command, short for "manual," is a crucial tool in Unix-like operating systems. It provides detailed documentation for commands, helping users understand their usage, options, and functionalities.

## Importance of Manuals

Manuals and documentation might seem intimidating at first, but they are invaluable resources for developers. As you gain experience, these documents will help you solve problems and use commands more effectively.
